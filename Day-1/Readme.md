# JavaScript Variable Declarations and Data Types

This document explains various concepts of variable declarations, reassignments, global and local scope, and data types in JavaScript using practical examples.

### Variable 

In JavaScript, variables can be declared using var, let, or const.

#### var

+ Function-scoped or globally-scoped.
+ Can be re-declared and updated.

#### let
+ Block-scoped.
+ Can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.

#### const
+ Block-scoped.
+ Must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be re-assigned.

### Global Variables
Variables declared outside any function or block are global variables. They can be accessed and modified anywhere in the code.

### Local Variables
Variables declared within a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

### Data Types
JavaScript has several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
