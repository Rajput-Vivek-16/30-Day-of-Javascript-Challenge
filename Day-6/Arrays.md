# Array Methods in JavaScript

## Array Creation and Access
**Definition:** Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. You can access elements using their index, starting from 0.

## Array Methods

#### Push Method
**Definition:** Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
**Use Case:** Appending elements to the end of an array.

#### Pop Method
**Definition:** Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
**Use Case:** Removing the last element from an array.

#### Unshift Method
**Definition:** Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
**Use Case:** Prepending elements to the start of an array.

#### Shift Method
**Definition:** Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
**Use Case:** Removing the first element from an array.

#### Slice Method
**Definition:** Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array.
**Use Case:** Extracting a part of an array without modifying the original array.

#### For Loop
**Definition:** Used to execute a block of code a number of times, iterating over array elements using their index.
**Use Case:** Performing operations on each element of an array.

#### ForEach Method
**Definition:** Executes a provided function once for each array element.
**Use Case:** Performing operations on each element of an array without returning a new array.

#### Splice Method
**Definition:** Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.
**Use Case:** Adding or removing elements from an array at a specific index.

#### Map Method
**Definition:** Creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
**Use Case:** Transforming elements of an array and returning a new array.

#### Filter Method
**Definition:** Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
**Use Case:** Selecting a subset of elements from an array based on a condition.

#### Reduce Method
**Definition:** Executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
**Use Case:** Computing a single value from an array, such as the sum of its elements.

## Multi-dimensional Arrays
**Definition:** Arrays containing other arrays as elements, enabling the representation of matrix-like structures.
**Use Case:** Representing and working with tabular data or matrices.
